Introduction

For this mini-project, you’ll deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it. Don’t worry if the links don’t go anywhere and the search box doesn’t do anything when you submit it. The goal is to start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned. For some of you, this may be the first time you’ve actually tried to “build” something in HTML (very exciting!).

Using the browser’s developer tools (right-clicking something on the page and clicking “inspect element” will get you there) will be your best friend. Build the page in a .html text file and open it in your browser to check it out.

When you’re building your project, you will probably end up doing several git add + git commit cycles before being ready to push it up to GitHub with git push origin main.

When writing code, it’s considered best practice to commit early and often. Commit every time you have a meaningful change in the code. This will create a timeline of your progress and show that your finished code didn’t appear out of nowhere.

If you have entered git push origin main and typed out your username and password, if you refresh your GitHub page, you should see new files added onto GitHub.

Okay, that’s enough Git for the moment – time to actually build stuff!
